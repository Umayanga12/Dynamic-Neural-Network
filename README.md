# Dynamic Artificial Neural Network (ANN) Code

This repository contains code for training a dynamic Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model using TensorFlow. The dynamic ANN allows for flexible architecture configurations, making it suitable for various tasks and datasets.

## Features

- Supports dynamic architecture configuration (number of layers, nodes per layer)
- Provides a simple example for training the model on simulated data.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- scikit-learn (for data splitting and preprocessing in the example)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Umayanga12/Dynamic-Neural-Network.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
3. Run the example script to train the dynamic ANN model:
   Note: Make sure to replace `train_dynamic_ann.py` with the name of your main script file if it's different.

4. Customize the model architecture, hyperparameters, and data preprocessing steps according to your specific requirements.

## Acknowledgments

- This code is based on TensorFlow's Keras API and inspired by various tutorials and documentation resources.
